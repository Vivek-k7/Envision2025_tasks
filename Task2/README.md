write here what you understood from each task, challenges faced if any\
Initially when i tried to implement the linear regression model i was faced with few errors such as overflow error and also few shape errors.
But soon after looking and taking inspiration from task 2 B(Logistic regression) where they had given guidance related to each step, and also using chatgpt to identify shape errors, i managed to fix my problems.


Also, in task 2C,' - what if we have a column that is a scalar multiple of another column, find out ways to see if one column is 'related' to another.':
I checked the correlation matrix and found the redundant features. I did this by checking if the corr is 1 between 2 features, as if corr is 1 it signifies that one of the features is (linearly related) scalar multiple of the other.
